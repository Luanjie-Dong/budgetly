# Budget

Budget is a personal finance management project designed to better track and manage my financial transactions efficiently. The project features a backend with a RESTful API that allows me to create, read, update, and delete my financial transactions stored in a local database. The backend is developed to ensure accurate extraction and manipulation of financial data, providing a seamless experience for me to manage my budgets effectively. The frontend, built with Next.js, offers dynamic routing to access transactions for different months and years, along with interactive visualizations using Chart.js to provide quick insights into my spending patterns. A shell script `start.sh` is also created to allow for one-button startup of both frontend and backend services.
