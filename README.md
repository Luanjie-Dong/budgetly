# Budget

Budget is a personal project designed to help me better manage my own financial transactions while serving as a practical exercise in backend and frontend development. The core of the project is a RESTful API built with Python and Flask, which allows me to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on my local database of my financial transactions. This backend system is engineered to ensure accurate data extraction, validation, and storage, providing a reliable foundation for tracking my spending and budgeting. The frontend, developed with Next.js, offers a dynamic and interactive interface with features like month/year-based transaction filtering and visualizations using Chart.js, giving me a real-world application to practice and refine my technical skills. A `start.sh` shell script simplifies the process of running both the backend and frontend services with a single command.
